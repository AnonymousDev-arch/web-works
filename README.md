# Duty by Design

This is a small collection of personal projects made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Nothing fancy — just things I’m building as I learn and grow. Some are simple ideas, others are small tools or creative bits. All of them are made with care, and with the intention to do good through what I create.

## Why I’m doing this

Because building things helps me understand better.  
Because code is a way to think clearly.  
Because I believe work — even small — should have purpose behind it.

## Projects

- They will keep getting updated/added to the current ones.

That’s it for now. Thanks for stopping by.
